# Airflow vs. Flyte Cheat Sheet

This Airflow vs. Flyte cheat sheet comes on the heels of two blog posts that consider Apache's Airflow orchestration engine in the context of Flyte: [Orchestrating Data Pipelines at Lyft: Comparing Flyte and Airflow](https://blog.flyte.org/orchestrating-data-pipelines-at-lyft-comparing-flyte-and-airflow) and [Scale Airflow for Machine Learning Tasks With the Flyte Airflow Provider](https://blog.flyte.org/scale-airflow-for-machine-learning-tasks-with-the-flyte-airflow-provider).

We've put this cheat sheet together for two reasons: To differentiate Flyte from Airflow and to illustrate the ease with which Flyte enables building data/ML pipelines. The cheat sheet will serve as a quick reference guide for Airflow users who want to understand how the [Flytekit](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit) (Flyte's Python SDK) syntax compares with the Airflow syntax, and identify differences in terminology and CLI commands.
