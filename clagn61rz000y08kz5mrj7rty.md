# Flyte's Latest...
## ‚Ä¶ Release üöÄ
Look for a **Flyte v1.3.0** release coming out in January 2023. Details on what that release will contain is in the section below, but keep an eye on our [GitHub](http://go.union.ai/jQkZcUUR) page for the official release.

## Have suggestions for Flyte?
We‚Äôd love to hear from you during our next Quarterly Planning Meeting in early January. We‚Äôll discuss the future of Flyte‚Äôs development, community involvement, and we‚Äôll take feature requests for upcoming releases!

Mark the event in your calendar [here](https://evt.to/auussgugw?utm_campaign=Flyte%20Monthly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

The first quarterly planning meeting was in October, when [Eduardo Apolinario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-apolinario-7b222035/?utm_campaign=Flyte%20Monthly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) covered the Flyte Roadmap for v1.3.0, and other features for the release in early 2023. The full rundown is in the recording below.

## ‚Ä¶ Success Story ü§ù
**Lacuna.ai**

Lacuna.ai is a transportation technology company that creates products to help its customers optimize traffic movement for cities, airports and other complex networks of moving vehicles.

At the most recent Flyte Community Sync, Machine Learning Engineer [Wen Shu Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenshutang?utm_campaign=Flyte%20Monthly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) spoke about the conception of Lacuna.ai and the problems it faced.

When evaluating workflow frameworks for Lacuna.ai, Wen Shu said he needed to balance data overhead and ease of adoption. Flyte‚Äôs clean abstractions and active community helped him choose Flyte. Here‚Äôs how Wen Shu convinced his team of data scientists that Flyte is critical for their workflows:
> It was a difficult case I had to make to the team because these things I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äî operational efficiency, or lower infrastructural overhead, or having good abstractions ‚Äî they are all very abstract concepts. For somebody who comes from an academic or pure data-science domain, it‚Äôs very hard to grasp. So I very much had to play the role of advocacy and try to evangelize it. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs tangible. So I think being able to start the process of converting some of our work into something tangible, into something you can visualize, that‚Äôs another advantage of Flyte that I really like.

Hear Wen Shu‚Äôs full journey in guiding Lacuna.ai‚Äôs adoption of Flyte below.

In the video below, [Eduardo Apolinario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-apolinario-7b222035/?utm_campaign=Flyte%20Monthly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) details Flyte‚Äôs recent v1.2.0 release, which includes changes such as extended workflow execution names, and a large performance improvement by offloading FlyteWorkflow CRD. In addition, Eduardo highlights the timeline for v1.3.0, and the highly requested features in store for that update: human-in-the-loop tasks, and out-of-core back-end plugins!

## Flyte Map Tasks
A Flyte blog post by [Vijay Saravana Jaishanker](https://hashnode.com/@vijaysaravana?utm_campaign=Flyte%20Monthly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) of Woven Planet describes how Flyte map tasks offer a simpler user experience than Spark workflows. Vijay goes into detail about Spark‚Äôs features and use cases, and where Flyte‚Äôs workflows are able to relieve some of the user pain points in areas where Spark‚Äôs more advanced features aren‚Äôt required. Examples and further comparison can be read in the article here:
