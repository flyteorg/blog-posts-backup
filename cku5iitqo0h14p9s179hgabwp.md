## Meet Flyte at Hacktoberfest 2021

Open-source is growing fast, so are its contributors. At Flyte, we have had meaningful contributions from many contributors who have helped us improve Flyte‚Äôs codebase and made us think through unseen perspectives. We have always wanted to have more such contributions to expand our horizons. We have been thinking about ways to get more people involved, and at the same time, give back to our community.

We know that October is the month of the year when open-source is the most alive. Revealing [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

Hacktoberfest is the month-long event held in October to celebrate open-source software, which is when you can contribute to open-source software irrespective of what you do. It indeed is an excellent opportunity to develop your skills, and most importantly, win limited edition swag üéÅ.

This year, we‚Äôre beyond thrilled to be a part of it. ‚ú®
